# 🏦 Python Banking Backend System

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a simple **banking backend application** developed using **Python**.  
It allows a user to create a bank account and perform basic banking operations such as:

- Account creation
- Deposit money
- Withdraw money
- Check account balance

The project demonstrates **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts and includes a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** built using **Python Tkinter**.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python 3
- Tkinter (for GUI)
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Command Line Interface (CLI) & GUI
- Git & GitHub (for version control)

---

## 🧱 Project Features
- Create a savings or current account
- Deposit money with validation
- Withdraw money with balance checks
- View current account balance
- Simple and user-friendly GUI

---

## 🧠 OOP Concepts Used
- **Class & Object** – Account class represents a bank account
- **Constructor (`__init__`)** – Initializes account details
- **Encapsulation** – Account data handled through methods
- **Methods** – deposit(), withdraw(), check_balance()

---

## 🖥️ Application UI
The application uses **Tkinter GUI** to provide:
- Input fields for account details
- Buttons for deposit, withdraw, and balance check
- Popup messages for success and error handling

Screenshots of the UI can be added here for demonstration.

## ▶️ How to Run the Project

### Prerequisites
- Python 3 installed on the system

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/banking-backend-python.git
